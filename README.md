# Badri's Django 1.6 starter template

This is a Django 1.6 starter template which I use for most of my current projects.
Choice of tools:
* postgres as the database
* Zurb foundation as the UI template.
* Angular.js as the frontend MVW
* coffeescript for writing js and SCSS for writing stylesheets. Both handled by [django-pipeline](https://github.com/cyberdelia/django-pipeline).

This template was inspired by [Airtonix's](https://github.com/airtonix/django-project-template) and [Two Scoops](https://github.com/twoscoops/django-twoscoops-project) templates and is licensed under MIT.
